STAKE HOLDER EMAIL:

Dear Stakeholder's Name,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am pleased to share the results of the Senior Data Analyst Take-Home Assessment for Fetch Rewards. The analysis was focused on understanding key metrics around user transactions, product sales, and insights into category performance. Below are the highlights of the findings:

Key Insights: Top 5 Brands by Receipts Scanned (Age 21+): The top brands by receipts scanned include Nerds Candy, Dove, and Trident, among others. Top 5 Brands by Sales (Users with 6+ Month Account Age): Brands like CVS, Dove, and Trident are leading in sales among users who have been with Fetch Rewards for six months or more. Health & Wellness Category Sales by Generation: Baby Boomers have contributed the highest share to sales in this category. Power Users: A set of users with the highest transaction frequency and total spend have been identified as "Power Users." Leading Brand in Dips & Salsa Category: Tostitos is the leading brand in this category. Year-over-Year Growth: We also analyzed the growth trends in transactions year-over-year, showing insights into the trajectory of Fetch Rewards' performance. Data Quality Observations: Brand and Manufacturer Data: Some product data showed missing or inconsistent brand information. Barcode Data: A percentage of transactions were missing barcode information, which could impact certain analyses. User Birth Dates: Some entries had unrealistic birth dates that could affect age-related analysis. Iâ€™ve documented the full analysis and insights in the repository, which you can access here. The repository includes all SQL queries, Python scripts, and outputs.

Next Steps: I would be happy to discuss these insights further and address any questions or suggestions you may have. Please let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific area or if there are additional analyses you'd like me to perform. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assessment. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards, Sai Prakash
